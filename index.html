                <div class="section-title">Project Overview & Objectives</div>
                <p>The systems that are currently implemented in hospitals and other organizations that require their employees to sign in and track their location are antiquated and tend to be complex and time consuming for the user, especially if the user is not technologically inclined. Some organizations do not have these systems installed. Our goal is to design a RFID based tracking system that is accurate enough to keep track of employees/patients location on campus and to create a interface that allows for the most technologically challenged users to quickly become accustomed to the system and use it with peak efficiency.</p>

                <div class="section-title">Who will use EasyTracker?</div>
                <p>Our project is intend to be marketed to the healthcare industry such as hospitals and nursing homes. But this project is not just limited to that field it has potential for applications in other areas where the location of employees, or guests need to be monitored.</p>

                <div class="section-title">How will EasyTracker improve their quality of life?</div>
                <p>This will improve our target populations quality of life by removing complex and antiquated systems with an efficient and simply designed product.</p>

                <div class="section-title">Benefits of EasyTracker</div>
                <p>One major benefit of EasyTracker is to give employers or management the ability to track their employees and know with relative certainty the location of their personal at all times.</p>

                <div class="section-title">Requirements of EasyTracker</div>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Needs to track location in real time</li>
                        <li>Needs to be easy to use</li>
                        <li>The price of the finished product needs to be reasonable</li>
                        <li>Must have built in security measures to protect the system against fraud</li>
                        <li>Installation of the system must be easy enough for the customer to implement the system without disrupting their day to day activities</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <div class="section-title">System flexibility & configuration</div>
                <p>The system must be flexible to allow for implementation across a wide market. The general concept for the system will remain the same for every customer but the features may change  according to customer specification. For example if the system was implemented in a hospital then we may need to add features that monitor the time that nurses spend in patients rooms.</p>

                <div class="section-title">User interface</div>
                <p>A simple UI including a real-time updating map of the building and everyones current location. Also included are a search for users and sectors of the building and a history page to view location history based on time.</p>

                <div class="section-title">Budget Constraints</div>
                <p>The major budget constraint is the installation of the RF modules throughout the building. With many readers, this could have an expensive chances are that the system may only consist of small RF modules that track the RFID tags throughout the building but the cost of installing the system for an entire building like a hospital may cost more than the average consumer will be able to pay.</p>

                <div class="section-title">Industry Standards</div>
                <p>We will most likely use industry standards unless we find some way to use WIFI networks to calculate the location of an individual.</p>

                <div class="section-title">Safety Requirements</div>
                <p>Safety Requirements for this project include building permissions, and potential hardware modification to the system that are malicious. Another requirement is for all location and tracking data to be secured and only accessible by authorized personnel. There are also FCC policies regarding radio communication which must be followed.</p>

                <div class="section-title">Hardware Requirements</div>
                <p>This system will need RFID tags for employee badges, and we will also need to build an RF transmitter that will use some sort of algorithm to locate the badge in space.</p>

                <div class="section-title">Technical Challenges</div>
                <p>The largest technical hurdle that we must overcome is what way do we track the location of a person. We need to find a reliable and safe way to do this and also the technique we use must be easily implemented with little cost to the user.</p>
